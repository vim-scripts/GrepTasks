DESCRIPTION
This plugin defines commands to search for tasks and TODO markers embedded in
files, and populates the quickfix list with the resulting lines. Most IDEs
offer such a view, too.

HOW IT WORKS
The :vimgrep command is used with a predefined pattern. Search targets for
the current buffer, all arguments, listed buffers, windows in the current tab
page or all tab pages can be used (leveraging the GrepHere.vim and
GrepCommands.vim plugins).

SEE ALSO
- To move to individual tasks and TODO markers in the current buffer without
  building and going through the quickfix list, you can use the companion
  TaskMotions.vim plugin (vimscript #3990).

USAGE
All commands search for case-sensitive occurrences of FIXME:, TODO:, and XXX:
in the files. (This is customizable via g:GrepTasks_PatternTemplate).
When the optional [{pattern}] is specified, only occurrences that contain the
{pattern} after the marker keyword are included.

:GrepHereTasks[!] [{pattern}]
                        Search for tasks and TODOs in the current buffer and
                        set the error list to the matches.

:ArgGrepTasks[!] [{pattern}]
                        Search for tasks and TODOs in all files from the
                        argument-list and set the error list to the matches.

:BufGrepTasks[!] [{pattern}]
                        Search for tasks and TODOs in all listed buffers and
                        set the error list to the matches.

:WinGrepTasks[!] [{pattern}]
                        Search for tasks and TODOs in all buffers visible in
                        the current tab and set the error list to the matches.

:TabGrepTasks[!] [{pattern}]
                        Search for tasks and TODOs in all buffers visible in
                        all tab pages and set the error list to the matches.

:VimGrepTasks[!] [/{pattern}/] {file} ...
                        Search for tasks and TODOs in the files {file} ... and
                        set the error list to the matches.
